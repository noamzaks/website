# ðŸ¦† Barvazim

After participating with friends in the BSides 2024 CTF, I became interested in creating a CTF team to compete in some challenges, and try to compete somewhat well.

For this, I wanted to set up some infrastructure, so that we can work on challenges in an organized fashion and not waste time on setting up our workspace, for instance, having to work with [Frida](https://frida.re/docs/android/)'s JS scripting without types, or remembering specific known RSA attacks.

I also wanted to create some tooling to encourage my team to create writeups using [Typst](https://typst.app/), which is a pleasure to work with.

We will post our writeups on the GitHub and probably use a small team website to showcase them as well.

The project is on my [GitHub](https://github.com/noamzaks/Barvazim).
